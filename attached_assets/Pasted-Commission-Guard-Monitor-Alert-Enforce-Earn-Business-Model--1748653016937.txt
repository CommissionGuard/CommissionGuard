Commission Guard:
Monitor. Alert. Enforce. Earn. Business Model
________________________________________________________________
1. Executive Summary
Commission Guard is a patent-pending, subscription-based SaaS platform that empowers real estate professionals to secure their commissions by tracking exclusive buyer and seller representation agreements and monitoring public property records for potential breaches. The platform alerts agents to unauthorized transactions and impending contract expirations, offering law firm partnerships to support litigation when needed.
Losing one $500,000 transaction with a 2% commission equates to $10,000 in lost GCI.
 For, as low as, $199.99/year, Commission Guard pays for itself nearly 50 times over if it catches even a single breach of contract.
 You can‚Äôt put a price on protecting your time, income, and hard work.

16. Conclusion
Commission Guard is more than a monitoring app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a proactive representation protection platform. It fills a critical gap in the real estate transaction lifecycle: ensuring agents get paid for the clients they work hard to secure. By combining contract compliance, data intelligence, breach detection, and legal follow-through, we‚Äôre empowering agents and brokerages to reclaim control over their commissions. 
As we scale, Commission Guard will become the industry standard in representation integrity and transactional accountability ‚Äî ensuring agents are always protected, and never unpaid.





NOTES/COMMENTS/IDEAS/QUESTIONS
Will be similar to a CRM: Each agent will have their own profile to log their clients data & contracts. Each broker/team leader will be able to oversee their agent‚Äôs profiles, clients & contracts to make sure they are staying on top of them. A broker will be notified if one of their agent‚Äôs clients breaches a contract and they can ensure their agent begins working on litigation for their commissions.
Can we figure out a way to check for members of LLC‚Äôs & corporation entity members for properties purchased under LLC‚Äôs? This is a potential backdoor route a client could attempt to go to avoid their breach of contract.
Can we build in our own e-sign profile? (Like docu-sign) Loaded with each MLS‚Äô documents for agents to have automatically signed & logged.
Do we need a consent form signed by the agents & clients to share these contracts with our app? (Consent with an attorney for their opinion)
Potential Upgrade Model? If a ‚Äúbreach‚Äù pops in the app, we‚Äôll have the agent request a secondary verification where we will run a FOIL Request for the specific property for the agent. (Either for an extra fee, or we offer ‚ÄúCommission Guard Pro‚Äù at a higher subscription rate which includes the FOIL Requests for secondary verifications)
NEED: Beta & Website up and running, refined, and refined some more
NEED: Patent started/filed & pending (Need to find an attorney for this)
NEED: Determine the requirements what is necessary for us to file a patent
