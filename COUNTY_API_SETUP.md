I am a licensed real estate professional requesting API access to your property records database for commission protection purposes.

Business Information:
- Business Name: [Your Business Name]

I need to monitor property deed recordings to detect when clients purchase properties during exclusive representation periods using different agents, which constitutes a breach of contract and commission loss.

Technical Requirements:
- Daily monitoring of deed recordings
- Search by buyer/seller names
- Include agent information in results
- Estimated 50-100 API calls per day

Please provide information about:
- API documentation and endpoints
- Authentication requirements

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Both counties typically require:
- Completed application form

- Technical specifications document
- Fee payment (usually $50-150 setup fee)

### Step 3: API Testing
Once approved:
- You'll receive API credentials

- Configure the system with your API keys

## Timeline

4. The monitoring will automatically switch to live county data
